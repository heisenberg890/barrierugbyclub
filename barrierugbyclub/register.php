* Field practices run all through May and June, we break for July and restart practices at the beginning of August through to the final tournament which is Ontario Provincials in Markham.<br />
* The Coaches are hoping to book a school gym for the month of April and run coaching clinics to introduce new players to rugby and get returning players warmed up for the upcoming season. There will be an additional cost for this but it will be nominal and just enough to cover the cost of the gym. We will communicate to parents by email as soon as we know if we have been able to secure the gym.
